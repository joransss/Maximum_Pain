## 2026-10-31: HUD restyled to match the Max Payne 3 reference
**Changed**
- **Health display:** the boxy body figure is replaced by a 3D human figure, matching your AK screenshots. It is Roblox's "Man" body, seen from behind in see-through grey. Each limb fills red from its lowest part up (feet first), and a limb in the red is red all over.
- **Painkiller count:** now a black number in a white square on the figure's back.
- **Slim bar:** a white bar beside the figure, a placeholder for the future bullet-time meter.
- **Status text:** red text with no box.
- **Gun list:** restyled to match the figure. No black tiles or white outlines; the guns are see-through grey shapes and the gun in hand is bright white. Ammo is written like Max Payne 3's "30 120": magazine in bold white, spare rounds in grey.
- **Keybinds:** unchanged, as asked.
- `ReplicatedStorage.Assets.UI.HealthFigure` added. `WeaponController` now sends the HUD numbers instead of a ready-made ammo string.

**Tested**
- Previewed in edit mode, then checked in play mode with no errors.
- The equipped AK row read "0 | 26 | 30" after a burst.
- With the left leg half damaged, the foot showed red, the shin half red and the thigh grey. The right arm in the red was fully red, and its two-handed guns faded in the list.

**Not done**
- The figure is chunkier than Max's slim one; a custom figure would need modelling.
- The bullet-time bar doesn't move yet.

## 2026-10-31: Weapon overhaul, camera, limb health and HUD
**Changed**
- **Ammo:** every gun now spawns with a full magazine plus **one spare magazine** (was several spare magazines).
- **Recoil:** CS2-style. Server-side spread grows while firing and settles after a pause. A fixed spray pattern per gun moves the camera, and each shot adds a sharp jerk.
- **Aiming:** right mouse button. The camera zooms in and spread tightens. The Barrett M107 gets a heavy second zoom into a scope overlay.
- **Tracers:** the thin instant line is replaced by a two-beam glowing streak that travels at the gun's bullet speed.
- **Muzzle flash:** the glowing ball is replaced by a real light that briefly lights the surroundings, plus flame, spark and smoke particles.
- **Impacts:** sparks and dust on surfaces, blood on bodies.
- **Camera:** locked to third person over the shoulder, with no first-person view. Q swaps shoulders. The character always faces where the camera points.
- **Limb health:** head, torso, both arms and both legs each have their own health. Limping, crawling, one-arm and disarmed rules apply, and the head or torso in the red kills.
- **Painkillers (H)** heal every limb. Players start with 3.
- **Shoot-dodge hooks:** the `ShootDodgeScale` attribute (1, 0.4 or 0) is ready for the dive when it's built.
- **Sprint** on Shift, blocked by limping or aiming.
- **HUD:** keybinds bottom left; weapon slots with white outline icons and ammo bottom right; body figure with painkiller count and status tag. Roblox's own hotbar and health bar are off.
- **Weapon switching:** keys 1–0 and the mouse wheel, since the Roblox hotbar is gone.
- **Code layout:** split into modules. Server: `WeaponServer`, `LimbServer`, `LimbService`. Shared: `WeaponConfig`, `WeaponMath`, `LimbRules`. Client: `ClientMain` starting `CameraController`, `CharacterController`, `WeaponController` and `Hud`. The old `WeaponClient` was removed.
- `StarterPlayer.EnableMouseLockOption` turned off, so Roblox's shift-lock doesn't fight the camera or the sprint key.

**Decisions**
- Hits stay instant (hitscan), as the networking notes recommend for the first prototype. The tracer only shows the bullet's travel.
- Recoil lives on the client camera; spread stays on the server. A no-recoil cheat is possible, but a no-spread cheat isn't.
- The client tells the server whether it is aiming. This is cheatable for now and logged as a follow-up.
- Weapon icons are drawn from untextured copies of the real gun models, so no images had to be uploaded.
- The "one magazine, no reserve" line in [[Max Payne 3 HUD and Combat UI Reference]] was replaced by this milestone's rule: one spare magazine.

**Tested in Studio play mode**
- No errors in the output log.
- Camera: locked third person on the right shoulder; Q moved it to the left shoulder and back.
- Aim zoom: 70 to 52 for normal guns. The sniper reached its overlay at 0.45 s, and switching guns mid-aim blended smoothly both ways.
- Firing: the MP5 fired at its rate. The muzzle light lit up during the burst and switched off after. The camera climbed 3.7° and recovered within 1.5 s.
- Spread on the server: AK hip 0.2° growing to 4°; aimed 0.3° growing to 1.8°.
- Tracers travelled at the configured speed (AK 2,000 studs/s) with a 7-stud streak.
- Reload used the single spare magazine (MP5 21 rounds → 30 / 21).
- Sprint: walk speed 24, back to 16 on release.
- Every limb rule, painkiller use and cooldown, gun dropping and equip blocking, real shots hitting the right limbs on a dummy, and torso death with a clean respawn. Details in [[Limb Health]].

**Not done or not tested**
- No animations (as requested), sounds, ammo pickups or touch controls.
- The shoot-dodge itself isn't built; only its hooks exist.
- Not yet tested with two real players or under network lag. Not tested on phones or consoles.
- Studio's Script Analysis (strict type warnings) wasn't checked. Only runtime errors were watched.

## 2026-10-31: First working guns
- Made the 13 guns in `ServerStorage.WeaponKit` usable: server-checked hitscan shots, ammo and reloads, fire-rate limits, spread that grows while firing, slide kick, muzzle flash and tracers, an ammo readout, and a Studio-only test loadout.
- Tested: fire rate, spam and bad-data rejection, walls blocking shots, shotgun pellets, headshots, reload cancelling, respawn.
- Superseded the same day by the overhaul above.
